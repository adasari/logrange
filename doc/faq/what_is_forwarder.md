# What is Forwarder?

Forwarder is a process which purpose is to extract logs (Data) from Aggregator and upload them to a 3-rd party system, e.g. Splunk (Destination). Data transformation can happen in between extraction and upload (ETL) in order to meet Destinationâ€™s data requirements/formats. Forwarder supports multiple upload Destinations which are defined in its configuration file (Configuration). Configuration can be changed while Forwarder is running and it is taken into account by Forwarder without need of restart. In its turn upload progress to each Destination is tracked separately and saved in a state file (State). Log extraction query (Query) for a particular Destination is defined separately in Configuration and determines what particular Data is going to be ETL-ed. Destination should support either secure or insecure rsyslog protocol in order to allow communication with Forwarder. Forwarder has runtime statistics (Statistics) which could be retrieved by a user in order to get some insight of how ETL process is going on for the defined Destinations.
